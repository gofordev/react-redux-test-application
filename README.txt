Project Overview

Task
A partial implementation of creating and editing expense is provided to you. However, 
clicking edit/create button on the expense list page, creating/editing modal doesn't appear.

Deliverable
- You are required to fix the code so that expense creating/editing modal works.
- Click submit button in the Edit modal, Edit action doesnâ€™t run.
- There is no any effect in the expense lists (updated expense). 
- You have to fix the code to ensure the edit is saved and is reflected in the expense list shown.To test your code, 
 open the Firefox browser from the bottom bar of the workspace and go to the url http://localhost:3000/login.
  You can click on the button <create an account> and register a new user in the expense management system. 
  Then use the new account to log in.
